# Welcome to Piranha vNext

This is a **complete rewrite** of Piranha CMS in order to achieve a more simple, flexible and future proof architecture. The framework is database & authentication agnostic with simple provider interfaces that makes sure that it can be adapted to different architectures.

## Licensing

Piranha CMS uses two different licenses. The **core libraries** are released under the **LGPL** license which is a **weak copyleft** license intended for software libraries. 

> "Weak copyleft" licenses are generally used for the creation of software libraries, to allow other software to link to the library, and then be redistributed without the legal requirement for the work to be distributed under the library's copyleft license. Only changes to the weak-copylefted software itself become subject to the copyleft provisions of such a license, not changes to the software that links to it. 

You can read the full article at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft#Strong_and_weak_copyleft](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft#Strong_and_weak_copyleft).

Everything else is released under the **MIT** license granting you permission to do pretty much anything you want.

### Why LGPL?

The reason for choosing this license is simple. I wrote this software intending that it should be **free of charge** and **available for everyone**. I did **not** write it so that the source code could be **modified** and used to create commercial proprietary products.

## Status

This repository is under development and is **not** intended for production use.

## Features

This version doesn't in any way have the same set of features as the currently released version of Piranha CMS. In order to get the community involved I wanted to release the source code as soon as possible to get as many contributors as possible.

## Roadmap

You can find the roadmap under **Milestones** in this repository.

## Contribute

Open Source is based on contributions. If you want to get involved, just **fork the repository** and get started! If you want to contribute more, team members are **more than welcome**!
